# KnowledgeTracker

📌 Project Overview — Knowledge & Project Tracker API
🎯 Goal

Build a real-world backend API using ASP.NET Core + MongoDB, designed to support a Vue frontend, while learning:

This is a learning-first but production-style pet project.

🧠 Product Concept (What the App Does)
A personal knowledge & project tracking system where a user can:

Add tasks to projects
Track progress
Store notes/descriptions
Later: filter, search, tag
